title: Machine Learning notes

This is an experimental document dealing with Machine Learning Mathematics and demonstrative code. It is experimental because
I am noting down the derivations based on several notable University courses. I will annotate each section to indicate the course content
I copy here. Eventually I will research and validate if my mental model is correct or not using additional material like diagrams and
TensorFlow code. I am yet to learn JAX.

The sections are random as I view course videos in no particular order. But Generative models form the underlying theme.

Errors will creep into this as my experience with this field is rather limited.

# Flow and Diffusion Models

This sentence uses `$` delimiters to show math inline: $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$
