An attempt to implement the Raft distributed protocol using OCaml 5 Eio, Effect Handlers, and capnp-rpc, which is a RPC library based on Eio.



1. The Eio _capnp-rpc_ library is still in a branch waiting to be merged.
2. The older LWT _capnp-rpc-lwt_ is used as Eio can integrate with it.
3. The newer _capnp-rpc_ based entirely on Eio will be used later.

   Everything involved in this has to be learned.

# Simple Eio Client/Server and LWT RPC

## Client

The details of the setup using _dune_ to build this will eventually be added to the README of the Git repository. Code is now directly posted here.

## main.ml

This file has code that implements 

1. A busy wait loop to continuously send and receive messages.( Commented now )
   
3. A RPC call.( This would be the relevant design for implementing the Raft distributed consensus protocol )

## Consensus module
This module holds the core logic to elect a leader.
This is the current state of this module.

{% highlight ocaml %}

open Eio.Std

struct

  let get_state = function
    | `Leader -> "leader."
    | `Follower -> "follower."
    | `Candidate -> "candidate."
    | `Dead -> " dead."

  type 'a cmid =  int

  type 'a peerids = 'a list


  (* Mutable term tracker *)
  type  'a currentterm = int ref

  type 'a votedfor =  int

  type 'cms cmstate =
  [ `Leader
  | `Follower
  | `Candidate
  | `Dead
  ]
  type election_reset_time = Mtime.t


  let election_reset_time =

## Timer events

My first attempt to raise a timer event and wait for it needs two loops, a mutex and a _Eio.Condition_. I did explore
other ways to set up a reactive, event-driven program but doesn't seem to build into eio. We have to develop a framework
on top of eio.
The code does seem complicated and the _mutex_ may not be required. I need to investigate the exact reason for a mutex( Go
code I drew inspiration from uses mutexes but eio works with Fibers and domains). I will take a look at this later.

_Fibers_ are lightweight-threads.


{% highlight ocaml %}

  let await_timeout timeout_mutex =
    Eio.Condition.await_no_mutex timeout_mutex;
    traceln "Timeout condition is set"

  let periodic_timer () =

   let cond = Eio.Condition.create () in
   Fiber.both (fun () ->
    let rec loop () =
      let timeout = Eio.Time.Timeout.seconds (Eio.Stdenv.mono_clock env) (float_of_int election_timeout) in
      Eio.Time.Timeout.run_exn timeout (fun () ->
        Eio.Condition.broadcast cond;
        ()
      );
      Fiber.yield ();
      loop ()
    in
    loop ()
  )
  (fun () ->
    let rec loop () =
       traceln "Waiting for timeout event ";
       await_timeout cond;
       traceln "timeout event ";
      Fiber.yield ();
      loop ()

    loop ()
  );
