When I was reading papers on Distributed Systems it was apparent that the algoeithms involved
were hard to understand just by drawing Lamport diagrams. Morever these research papers have Math
notation.

I have rendered a lamport diagram like this.

Even at this abstract level it was hard to understand how this protocol works. So as usual I looked
at ways to render it in code. Writing code for these complex protocols and testing it using Unit tests
was impossible. Further research led me to believe that specifications for verification of these protocols
can be coded. 
I had already come across <i>Hillel Wayne's</i> Practical TLA<sup>+</sup> book a few years
back. So I started reading that and naturally I was drawn to TLA<sup>+</sup> and the Pluscal
algorithm language.

### Development environment

I didn't find any IDE except the TLA<sup>+</sup> Toolkit which was hard
to use. One could configure it and improve the font size in several places
but still it is a difficult development environment.
