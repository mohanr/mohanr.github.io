When I was reading papers on Distributed Systems it was apparent that the algoeithms involved
were hard to understand just by drawing Lamport diagrams. Morever these research papers have Math
notation.

I have rendered a lamport diagram like this.

Even at this abstract level it was hard to understand how this protocol works. So as usual I looked
at ways to render it in code. Writing code for these complex protocols and testing it using Unit tests
was impossible without a specification and naturally I was drawn to TLA<sup>+</sup> and the Pluscal
algorithm language.
